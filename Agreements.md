## Rationale

All data submitted to Dash will be made available via the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY) license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). We recognize that this will not fit the needs of all researchers, however it simplifies implementation of Dash at this early stage.  

Our use of CC-BY to make the terms of reuse explicit has some important advantages (the following text is borrowed heavily from [the Dryad repository's FAQ](http://datadryad.org/pages/faq) on their use of CC-BY licenses):

* Interoperability: Since CC-BY is both human and machine-readable, other people and indexing services will automatically be able to determine the terms of use.
* Universality: CC-BY is a single mechanism that is both global and universal, covering all data and all countries. It is also widely recognized.
* Simplicity: There is no need for humans to make, or respond to, individual data requests. This allows more scientists to spend their time doing science.

## Data submission agreement

**Goal**: Assert that the Dash user has agreed to the data submission terms.

**Pre-conditions**: The user is logged into the system and has uploaded a dataset with all required information.

When the user gets to the final data submission (i.e., "Review and Submit") screen, they first review the metadata and verify all data files are uploaded. The next step is to submit the data package (metadata and data) to Dash. In order to proceed, they must first click the checkbox next to the "Submit to Dash" button. This signifies that they have agreed to the data submission terms, which are described next to the check box.

This text will appear next to the "Submit to Dash" button, along with a checkbox. The checkbox must be clicked in order to successfully submit to Dash. Otherwise, the user will receive an error message.

### Submission text
> By clicking this checkbox, I certify that I agree to the Dash [Terms of use](http://www.cdlib.org/about/terms.html). I understand that by submitting data to Dash, I am agreeing to release it under the terms of the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY) license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license. I warrant that sharing my submission under these terms does not violate any privacy, copyright, or other rights of any person or third party. For more information on why Dash uses CC-BY, see our [policies page](http://dash.ucop.edu/policies). 

_Note: The Dash policies page is still under construction._

## Data use agreement

Because all data in Dash will be available under a CC-BY license, no data use agreement is required. Instead, each dataset landing page will bear the CC-BY logo with a link to more information.


## Policies and terms of use

Dash will use the generic [CDL Terms of Use](http://www.cdlib.org/about/terms.html). With regard to other policies, we are currently developing text about data takedown policies, content guidelines, and other information that will appear on a "Policies" page of the Dash website. See [policies](policies).
