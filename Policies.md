We have drafted a potential set of policies that will govern Dash. This document is for discussion and is by no means a final document - your input is critical to implementing Dash. 

**Please comment directly on the [Google Doc, _Dash Policies Draft_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k-2T-p9q9cGI0LKztw7Wkj6lO4kM8z3pGu-nPIT_lm8/edit?usp=sharing).**

All text on the Google Doc is below for your reference. Please refer to the [Agreements](agreements) page for more information on the proposed data use and submission agreements for Dash.

### Content

**Scope**

All fields of scholarship. All types of research artifacts. Content must not violate privacy or copyright, or breach confidentiality or nondisclosure for data collected from human subjects.

**Status of research data**

Complete, final research datasets are accepted. The content does not need to be associated with a published research article.

**Eligible depositors**

Access to the Dash data submission system is limited to individuals affiliated with UC campuses that have implemented Dash. Contact uc3@ucop.edu for more information.

**Versions**

All versions of a dataset will be kept in the Merritt Repository, but only the most recent version will be available through the Dash user interface. Users may not delete datasets once they’ve been submitted, but may submit new versions whenever appropriate. 

**Data file formats**

All formats are allowed.

**Volume and size limitations**

10GB per file size constraint. Quotas are likely to be introduced at a later stage. All data files are stored in the Merritt Repository. More information about the Merritt Repository Service is available in the white paper [_UC3, Merritt and Long-term Preservation_](https://merritt.cdlib.org/d/ark%3A%2F13030%2Fm52f7p63/2/producer%2FUC3-Merritt-preservation-latest.pdf) (PDF). 

**Data quality**

All information is provided “as-is” and the user shall hold Dash and information providers supplying data to Dash free and harmless in connection with the use of such information.

**Embargo status**

Dash does not currently have the capability for users to deposit content under an embargo status.

**Revocation of DOIs**

Content not considered to fall under the scope of the repository will be removed and associated DOIs issued by Dash revoked. Please signal promptly any suspected policy violations, ideally no later than 24 hours from upload. User access may be revoked on violation of [Terms of Use](http://www.cdlib.org/about/terms.html).

**Withdrawal of DOIs**

Withdrawal is considered an exceptional action which normally should be requested and fully justified by the original contributor. In any other circumstance reasonable attempts will be made to contact the original contributor to obtain consent.

### Access and reuse of data

**Access to data objects**

All data deposited into Dash is publicly available under a [CC-BY-4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

**Use and reuse of data objects**

Use and reuse is subject to the [CC-BY-4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

**Tracking users and statistics**

The California Digital Library does not track, collect or retain personal information from users of Dash, except as otherwise provided herein. In order to enhance Dash and monitor traffic, non-personal information such as IP addresses and cookies may be tracked and retained. User provided information, like corrections of metadata or paper claims, will be integrated into the database without displaying its source and may be shared with other services.

The California Digital Library will take all reasonable measures to protect the privacy of its users and to resist service interruptions, intentional attacks, or other events that may compromise the security of the Dash website.

### Preservation of data

All data submitted to Dash will be housed in the CDL’s Merritt Repository. For a full description of the services provided by Merritt, see this document: [_UC3, Merritt, and Long-term preservation_](https://merritt.cdlib.org/d/ark%3A%2F13030%2Fm52f7p63/2/producer%2FUC3-Merritt-preservation-latest.pdf) (PDF).

**Retention period**

Items will be retained for the lifetime of the repository.

**Functional preservation**

Dash makes no promises of usability and understandability of deposited objects over time.

**File preservation**

Data files are replicated with multiple copies in multiple geographic locations; metadata is backed up on a nightly basis.

**Fixity and authenticity**

All data files are stored along with a SHA-256 checksum of the file content. Regular checks of files against their checksums are made.

### Succession plans

In case of closure of the repository, reasonable efforts will be made to integrate all content into suitable alternative institutional and/or subject based repositories.

All information is provided “as-is” and the user shall hold the California Digital Library, UC Campus, and information providers supplying data to Dash free and harmless in connection with the use of such information.
