**Note:** We do not have plans to charge individual Dash users. However, we will be billing campuses for storage used by their Dash instances. This cost may be passed on to campus users; contact your campus library for more information. [DataONE Dash](http://oneshare.cdlib.org) will remain free for users.

## Plan for Covering Dash Costs

We continue to work with the UCOP administration to get final approval for our Merritt recharge proposal. Here are the components of our proposal, which has been modified based on feedback from our campus partners.  For UC clients the only charges are for storage; there is no separate service fee. The proposal is based on a **$0.65/GB per year** price point, which reflects our actual costs to provision replicated storage at SDSC and UCLA.  We also plan to offer a paid-up option of $4.82/GB for 10 years. Use our [costs calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15PyhRDnwOt1hEfZW6EFyFlw4dfoKo5drHgxJ7OBktFg/edit?pli=1#gid=0) to determine anticipated dash costs.

## Details

* We plan to charge each campus for the storage used by their researchers. We are working on an agreement between CDL and the campuses to establish the details of this arrangement. Campuses (the library or other units as appropriate)  then can decide if and how they will institute recharges for their researchers. 
* There will be a low minimum charge requirement for each billing cycle. This will be on the order of $50 (equivalent to 77 GB), and is intended to reduce the chance that CDL will need to accommodate very small charge totals.
* After the 77 GB minimum purchase, campuses will be charged only for what they have actually used. 
* We will provide one bill for each campus on an annual basis.
* Storage charges are based on the maximum cumulative amount of storage used over the course of the previous 12 months.  Thus, data that is submitted and subsequently deleted will nevertheless contribute to that yearâ€™s cumulative usage.
* The first billing period for Dash will be 1 July 2015 - 30 June 2016.  While no bills will be issued for data contributed during the interim  period from now until 30 June 2015, that data will be counted in the cumulative total in the first and subsequent billing cycles. 
* CDL will provide campuses with monthly updates on their usage. 
* CDL will provide campuses with current storage use by Monday, 1 December.

## Next steps

* Obtain UCOP approval of our recharge proposal (expected January 2015)
* Obtain signed agreements for each campus. We will contact campuses once the agreement text is finalized.
* Add language to the Dash websites describing the costs; provide campus-level contacts for more questions.
