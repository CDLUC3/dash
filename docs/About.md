## Overview 

Dash is a new, easy-to-use solution for the effective curation of and access to campus research data. It is designed to be a simple self-service curation tool for researchers to archive and share their datasets. 

**Tasks Dash helps you perform:**
* Prepare data for curation by reviewing best practice guidance for the creation or acquisition of digital research data.
* Select data for curation through local file browse or drag-and-drop operation.
* Describe data in terms of the DataCite metadata schema.
* Identify data with a persistent DOI for permanent citation and discovery.
* Preserve, Manage, and Share data by uploading to a public Merritt collection.
* Discover and retrieve data through faceted search and browse.

## Importance of Data Sharing

Data sharing is critical for the advancement of scientific knowledge. Researchers benefit from increased collaborations, validation, and recognition of their work; institutions and funders benefit from the measurable increase in the impact of their resources; and society benefits from the faster pace at which science can progress. There are several barriers to providing access to data, and currently data sharing is mostly done by large, well funded multi-investigator projects. If these barriers were addressed, allowing individual investigators to easily and quickly share their primary research data, we could create a new culture of transparency and efficiency - likely resulting in major impacts on scientific advancement.

## Who We Are

XXXX Dash is a collaborative project between the XXX Library and the UC Curation Center (UC3) at the California Digital Library.

### The UC Curation Center
The UC3 is a creative partnership bringing together the expertise and resources of the CDL, the ten UC campuses, and the broader international curation community. The group fosters collaborative analysis, projects, and solutions to ensure the long-term viability and usability of curated digital content. Examples of tools and services include the Merritt Data Repository, the EZID persistent identifier service, the Web Archiving Service (WAS), and Data Management Planning Tool (DMPTool).

### Dash Origins
The Dash project began as [DataShare](http://datashare.ucsf.edu), a collaboration between University of California San Francisco’s Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI), the UCSF Library, and UC3.

[UCSF's Clinical & Translational Science Institute](http://ctsi.ucsf.edu/) facilitates the rapid translation of research to improvements in patient and community health. It is a cross-school, campus-wide institute with scientist leaders at its helm. To achieve its goal of accelerating research to advance health, CTSI provides infrastructure, services, and training to support clinical and translational research. To advance its mission, it also develops broad coalitions and partnerships at the local and national levels to enable a transformation of the research environment. Established in 2006, the Institute was among the first of the now 60-member, National Institutes of Health-funded, Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) consortium.

The mission of the [UCSF Library](http://www.library.ucsf.edu/) and [Center for Knowledge Management](http://www.library.ucsf.edu/about/ckm) is to advance science, foster excellence in teaching and learning, and promote health through the collection, development, organization, and dissemination of the world's health sciences knowledge base. It delivers services to the UCSF community and works with faculty on a number of collaborative projects in both education and research. On May 21, 2012 the UCSF faculty approved an Open Access policy for journal articles and the Library is developing systems and strategies to comply with the policy.

This project was originally envisioned by Michael Weiner M.D., the director for the [Center for Imaging of Neurodegenerative Diseases](http://www.radiology.ucsf.edu/cind) at UCSF. Weiner’s experience as the Principal Investigator of the [Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative](http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/) (ADNI) led him to conclude that widespread data sharing can be achieved now, with great scientific and economic benefits. All ADNI raw data is immediately shared, without embargo, with all scientists in the world. The project is very successful: more than 300 publications have resulted from use of the ADNI data resource. This success demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of sharing data.
