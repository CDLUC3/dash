### Contents of the README.txt (automatically added to the data package)

The digital object you have downloaded from Merritt contains the dataset as well as a number of system files and folders. In order to access the dataset:

1. You'll see a folder named "v00X" corresponding to the version number of the digital object. Open this folder.
2. Open the "full" folder.
3. Open the "producer" folder. You will find the data here.

More information on folders, files and naming conventions in Merritt objects can be found in the "D-flat" specification: [confluence.ucop.edu/display/Curation/D-flat](https://confluence.ucop.edu/display/Curation/D-flat). Please contact us at uc3@ucop.edu with any questions.
