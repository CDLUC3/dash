## Overview 

Dash is a new tool for researchers to describe, upload, and share their research data. It is designed to be a simple self-service curation tool for researchers, and helps them perform the following tasks:

* Prepare data for curation by reviewing best practice guidance for the creation or acquisition of digital research data.
* Select data for curation through local file browse or drag-and-drop operation.
* Describe data in terms of the DataCite metadata schema.
* Identify data with a persistent digital object identifier (DOI) for permanent citation and discovery.
* Preserve, manage, and share data by uploading to a public [Merritt repository](http://merritt.cdlib.org) collection.
* Discover and retrieve data through faceted search and browse.

## Importance of Data Sharing

Data sharing is critical for the advancement of knowledge. Researchers benefit from increased collaborations, validation, and recognition of their work; institutions and funders benefit from the measurable increase in the impact of their resources; and society benefits from the faster pace at which research can progress. There are several barriers to providing access to data, and currently data sharing is mostly done by large, well funded multi-investigator projects. If these barriers were addressed, allowing individual investigators to easily and quickly share their primary research data, we could create a new culture of transparency and efficiency - likely resulting in major impacts on knowledge advancement.

## Who We Are

XXXX Dash is a collaborative project between the XXX Library and the UC Curation Center (UC3) at the California Digital Library.

### The UC Curation Center
The [UC3](http://cdlib.org/services/uc3) is a creative partnership bringing together the expertise and resources of the CDL, the ten UC campuses, and the broader international curation community. The group fosters collaborative analysis, projects, and solutions to ensure the long-term viability and usability of curated digital content. Examples of tools and services include the [Merritt Repository](http://merritt.cdlib.org), the [Web Archiving Service](http://was.cdlib.org/) (WAS), and the [Data Management Planning Tool](http://dmptool.org) (DMPTool).

### Dash Origins
The Dash project began as [DataShare](http://datashare.ucsf.edu), a collaboration among [UC3](http://www.cdlib.org/services/uc3), the [University of California San Francisco Library](http://www.library.ucsf.edu/) and [Center for Knowledge Management](http://www.library.ucsf.edu/about/ckm), and the UCSF [Clinical and Translational Science Institute](http://ctsi.ucsf.edu/) (CTSI). CTSI is part of the Clinical and Translational Science Award program funded by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences at the National Institutes of Health (Grant Number UL1 TR000004).
