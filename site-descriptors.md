**Problem**: Tracking publications associated with a field station or site is difficult. There is no clear or standard way to cite field station descriptions.

**Proposal**: Create individual, citable “publications” with associated persistent identifiers for each field station (more generically called a “site”). Collect these publications in a central location.

## What these Publications Look Like

* Can be used to describe any site used for research. Examples include field stations, marine labs, sampling sites, collection locations, instrument locations, laboratory facilities, etc..
* Each publication gets a DOI
* Descriptions can be updated periodically. Updates = versions. Can’t edit existing document; must submit new one. Can use same DOI for single site though.
* Can be exported as EML XML or as human-readable PDF
* Format
  * Standardized, structured description of site - metadata fields, plus supplementary material such as images, descriptive blurbs, etc.
  * Decisions for each field: what it’s called, whether it’s mandatory, whether it has limited responses, how it maps to datacite, how it maps to EML 
  * See [Site Descriptor Content Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19eWVdOzADhDsghOq-Y4Jw4HHE0GraoBgKdbOhNJ86s8/edit#gid=0) for more information/example

## How the Publications are Collected/Displayed:

Collect these Site Descriptors in the general use <a href="http://dataone.org" target="_blank">DataONE</a> repository, ONEShare. The user interface will be a new instance of the existing <a href="http://dash.cdlib.org" target="_blank">UC3 Dash service</a> (under development) with some modifications for Site Descriptors.

## Existing descriptions

* Example from NRS: metadata submitted to KNB; got a DOI [http://nrs.ucop.edu/biblioDOI.htm](http://nrs.ucop.edu/biblioDOI.htm)
* Web page from Sierra Nevada field station: [vesr.ucnrs.org/pages/snarlmoreinfo.html](http://vesr.ucnrs.org/pages/snarlmoreinfo.html) 
* OBFS online directory: [http://www.obfs.org/directories](http://www.obfs.org/directories)
* OBFS map with link to field station websites: [http://www.obfs.org/station-map](http://www.obfs.org/station-map)
* SiteDB from LTER: [http://im.lternet.edu/projects/SiteDB](http://im.lternet.edu/projects/SiteDB)
* LTER sites descriptions:  [http://www.lternet.edu/lter-sites](http://www.lternet.edu/lter-sites)
