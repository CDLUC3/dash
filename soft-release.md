### Whatâ€™s a soft release?

We want to be sure Dash is running properly before we promote it widely and it is used extensively by the researcher community. A "soft release" strategy means the Dash application is available to anyone but we don't encourage everyone to use it yet. Help us get Dash ready for wide release with much fanfare by testing. This is planned for November 1st.

**Please complete your testing and log all bugs/enhancements/issues by Friday, October 10th**

### On Dash Staging

* Test the application using [test scripts provided](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ijZZiqtMtdJnfQd8MH6Qmq4BBr4njiYInVYJzYu5eSc/edit) 
* Encourage "friends and family" to help with testing
* Check for bugs and usability (**Note**: only major bugs will be fixed; all others logged but not necessarily going to be addressed soon)
* Report back - add items or issues, with screenshots and URLs, to [GitHub Issues](http://github.com/CDLUC3/dash/issues). Alternatively email them to uc3@ucop.edu (GitHub issues preferred)

### On Dash Production

* Work with a selected number of early adopter researchers
* Restrict to 10s of MB size datasets until testing is complete
* Report back - add items or issues, with screenshots and URLs, to [GitHub Issues](http://github.com/CDLUC3/dash/issues). Alternatively email them to uc3@ucop.edu (GitHub issues preferred)
