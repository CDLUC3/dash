## Where to Start?

There are multiple instances of the Dash tool (with different URLs) that all have similar functions, look, and feel. 

### Researchers at UC Merced, UCLA, UC Irvine, UC Berkeley, or UCOP

You can use your campus-specific Dash instance:

* UC Merced: [dash.ucmerced.edu](http://dash.ucmerced.edu)
* UCLA: [dash.ucla.edu](http://dash.ucla.edu)
* UC Irvine: [dash.lib.uci.edu](dash.lib.uci.edu)
* UC Berkeley: [dash.berkeley.edu](http://dash.berkeley.edu)
* UCOP: [dash.ucop.edu](http://dash.ucop.edu)

### Other Researchers

If your are not a University of California researcher or your campus is not a partner, you can use [DataONE Dash](http://oneshare.cdlib.org). This instance is available to anyone, free of charge. Use your Google credentials to deposit data.

### Data Visibility

Data deposited into _any_ Dash instance is **visible throughout all of Dash**. For example, if you are a UC Merced researcher and use dash.ucmerced.edu to deposit data, your dataset will appear in search results for individuals looking for data via any of the Dash instances, regardless of campus affiliation.
