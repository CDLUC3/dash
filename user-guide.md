## Brochure Page Overview

![brochure page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CDLUC3/dash/gh-pages/images/userguide/brochure.jpg)

You can get to the brochure page by either clicking on the Dash logo in the top left corner of any Dash instance, or by going to [dash.cdlib.org](http://dash.cdlib.org).

### On this page:
1. General information about the Dash project. "Find Data" takes you to the data search/browse site for the UCOP instance of Dash.
2. Researchers that are not part of the University of California, or whose UC campus is not listed on the right, can use this link to go to [DataONE Dash](http://oneshare.cdlib.org).
3. Visit a campus-specific instance of Dash by clicking on the campus' button. Researchers from that campus can deposit data into Dash using their campus instance of the service.

* UC Merced: [dash.ucmerced.edu](http://dash.ucmerced.edu)
