## Where to Start?

There are multiple instances of the Dash tool (with different URLs) that all have similar functions, look, and feel.

_Read more on why [here](https://github.com/CDLUC3/dash/issues/35)_. 

**Researchers at UC Merced, UCLA, UC Irvine, UC Berkeley, or UCOP** can use their campus-specific Dash instance:

* [UC Berkeley Dash](https://dash.berkeley.edu): dash.berkeley.edu
* [UC Irvine Dash](https://dash.lib.uci.edu): dash.lib.uci.edu
* [UCLA Dash](https://dash.ucla.edu): dash.ucla.edu
* [UC Merced Dash](https://dash.ucmerced.edu): dash.ucmerced.edu
* [UCOP Dash](https://dash.ucop.edu): dash.ucop.edu

**Other Researchers** (not a University of California researcher or your campus is not a partner) can use [DataONE Dash](http://oneshare.cdlib.org) (oneshare.cdlib.org). This instance is available to anyone, free of charge. Use your Google credentials to deposit data.

**Note:** Data deposited into _any_ Dash instance is **visible throughout all of Dash**. For example, if you are a UC Merced researcher and use dash.ucmerced.edu to deposit data, your dataset will appear in search results for individuals looking for data via any of the Dash instances, regardless of campus affiliation.
